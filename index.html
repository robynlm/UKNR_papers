                <div class="paper-abstract">We introduce Einstein Fields, a neural representation that is designed to compress computationally intensive four-dimensional numerical relativity simulations into compact implicit neural network weights. By modeling the <em>metric</em>, which is the core tensor field of general relativity, Einstein Fields enable the derivation of physical quantities via automatic differentiation. However, unlike conventional neural fields (e.g., signed distance, occupancy, or radiance fields), Einstein Fields are <em>Neural Tensor Fields</em> with the key difference that when encoding the spacetime geometry of general relativity into neural field representations, dynamics emerge naturally as a byproduct. Einstein Fields show remarkable potential, including continuum modeling of 4D spacetime, mesh-agnosticity, storage efficiency, derivative accuracy, and ease of use. We address these challenges across several canonical test beds of general relativity and release an open source JAX-based library, paving the way for more scalable and expressive approaches to numerical relativity.

                <div class="paper-abstract">Standardizing the definition of eccentricity is necessary for unambiguous inference of the orbital eccentricity of compact binaries from gravitational wave observations. In previous works, we proposed a definition of eccentricity for systems without spin-precession that relies solely on the gravitational waveform, is applicable to any waveform model, and has the correct Newtonian limit. In this work, we extend this definition to spin-precessing systems. This simple yet effective extension relies on first transforming the waveform from the inertial frame to the coprecessing frame, and then adopting an amplitude and a phase with reduced spin-induced effects. Our method includes a robust procedure for filtering out spin-induced modulations, which become non-negligible in the small eccentricity and large spin-precession regime. Finally, we apply our method to a set of Numerical Relativity and Effective One Body waveforms to showcase its robustness for generic eccentric spin-precessing binaries. We make our method public via Python implementation in <code>gw_eccentricity</code>.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">The study of unbound binary-black-hole encounters provides a gauge-invariant approach to exploring strong-field gravitational interactions in two-body systems, which can subsequently inform waveform models for bound orbits. In this work, we present 60 new highly accurate numerical relativity (NR) simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC). Our simulations include 14 spin-aligned configurations, as well as 16 configurations with unequal masses, up to a mass ratio of 10. We perform the first direct comparison of scattering angles computed using different NR codes, finding good agreement. We compare our NR scattering angle results to the post-Minkowskian (PM)-based effective-one-body (EOB) closed-form models SEOB-PM and $w_{\rm EOB}$, finding less than 5% deviation except near the scatter-capture separatrix. Comparisons with the post-Newtonian-based EOB evolution models SEOBNRv5 and TEOBResumS-Dalí reveal that the former agrees within 8% accuracy with non-spinning NR results across most parameter ranges, whereas the latter matches similarly at lower energies but diverges significantly at higher energies. Both evolution EOB models exhibit increased deviations for spinning systems, predicting a notably different location of the capture separatrix compared to NR. Our key finding is the first measurement of disparate scattering angles from NR simulations due to asymmetric gravitational-wave emission. We compare these results to SEOB-PM models constructed to calculate the scattering angle of a single black hole in asymmetric systems.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Vector boson stars, also known as Proca stars, exhibit remarkable dynamical robustness, making them strong candidates for potential astrophysical exotic compact objects. In search of theoretically well-motivated Proca star models, we recently introduced the $\ell$-Proca star, a multi-field extension of the spherical Proca star, whose $(2\ell + 1)$ constitutive fields have the same time and radial dependence, and their angular structure is given by all the available spherical harmonics for a fixed angular momentum number $\ell$. In this work, we conduct a non-linear stability analysis of these stars by numerically solving the Einstein-(multi, complex) Proca system for the case of $\ell = 2$, which are formed by five constitutive independent, complex Proca fields with $m = 0, |1|$, and $|2|$. Our analysis is based on long-term, fully non-linear, 3-dimensional numerical-relativity simulations without imposing any symmetry. We find that ($\ell=2$)-Proca stars are unstable throughout their entire domain of existence. In particular, we highlight that less compact configurations dynamically lose their global spherical symmetry, developing a non-axisymmetric $\tilde{m}=4$ mode instability and a subsequent migration into a new kind of multi-field Proca star formed by fields with different angular momentum number, $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$, that we identify as unstable multi-$\ell$ Proca stars.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">We present the frequency-domain quasi-circular precessing binary-black-hole model PhenomXPNR. This model combines the most precise available post-Newtonian description of the evolution of the precession dynamics through inspiral with merger-ringdown model informed by numerical relativity. This, along with a phenomenological model of the dominant multipole asymmetries, results in the most accurate and complete representation of the physics of precessing binaries natively in the frequency-domain to date. All state-of-the-art precessing models show bias when inferring binary parameters in certain regions of the parameter space. We demonstrate that the developments presented ensure that for some precessing systems PhenomXPNR shows the least degree of bias. Further, as a phenomenological, frequency-domain model, PhenomXPNR remains one of the most computationally efficient models available and is therefore well-suited to the era of gravitational-wave astronomy with its ever growing rate of detected signals.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Cosmography is a widely applied method to infer kinematics of the Universe at small cosmological scales while remaining agnostic about the theory of gravity at play. Usually cosmologists invoke the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in cosmographic analyses, however generalised approaches allow for analyses outside of any assumed geometrical model. These methods have great promise to be able to model-independently map the cosmic neighborhood where the Universe has not yet converged to isotropy. In this regime, anisotropies can bias parameter inferences if they are not accounted for, and thus must be included for precision cosmology analyses, even when the principle aim is to infer the background cosmology. In this paper, we develop a method to predict the dipole in luminosity distances that arises due to nearby inhomogeneities. This is the leading-order correction to the standard isotropic distance-redshift law. Within a very broad class of general-relativistic universe models, we provide an interpretation of the dipole in terms of the gradients in expansion rate and density which is free from any underlying background cosmology. We use numerical relativity simulations, with improved initial data methods, alongside fully relativistic ray tracing to test the power of our prediction. We find our prediction accurately captures the dipole signature in our simulations to within ~10% for redshifts $z\lesssim 0.07$ in reasonably smooth simulations. In the presence of more non-linear density fields, we find this reduces to $z\lesssim 0.02$. This represents up to an order of magnitude improvement with respect to what is achieved by naive, local cosmography-based predictions. Our paper thus addresses important issues regarding convergence properties of anisotropic cosmographic series expansions that would otherwise limit their applicability to very narrow redshift ranges.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">In this paper, we present 52 new numerical-relativity (NR) simulations of black-hole-neutron-star merger (BHNS) mergers and employ the data to inform TEOBResumS-Dalí: a multipolar effective-one-body model also including precession and eccentricity. Our simulations target quasicircular mergers and the parameter space region characterized by significant tidal disruption of the star. Convergent gravitational waveforms are produced with a detailed error budget after extensive numerical tests. We study in detail the multipolar amplitude hierarchy and identify a characteristic tidal signature in the $(\ell,m)=(2,0)$, and $(3,0)$ modes. We also develop new NR-informed models for the remnant black hole and for the recoil velocity. The numerical data is then used to inform next-to-quasicircular corrections and the ringdown of TEOBResumS-Dalí for BHNS. We show an overall order of magnitude improvement in the waveform's amplitude at merger and more consistent multipoles over our older TEOBResumS-GIOTTO for BHNS. TEOBResumS-Dalí is further validated with a new 12 orbit precessing simulation, showing phase and relative amplitude differences below $\sim 0.5$ (rad) throughout the inspiral. The computed mismatches including all the modes lie at the one percent level for low inclinations. Finally, we demonstrate for the first time that TEOBResumS-Dalí can produce robust waveforms with both eccentricity and precession, and use the model to identify the most urgent BHNS to simulate for waveform development. Our new numerical data are publicly released as part of the CoRe database.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">A black hole binary approaching merger undergoes changes in its inspiral rate as energy and angular momentum are lost from the orbits into the horizons. This effect strengthens as the black holes come closer. We use numerical relativity data to model this so-called tidal heating in the strong gravity regime. We present a frequency-domain approximant for nonspinning black hole binaries that accounts for tidal heating effects up to the merger frequency. The approximant includes horizon parameters that characterize the nature of the compact objects. By applying this model to a binary black hole baseline that incorporates tidal heating, one can construct a more accurate point-particle waveform, one that is devoid of finite-size effects of the component objects. We also discuss its ramifications in modeling binary neutron star systems.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Binary neutron star mergers can produce extreme magnetic fields, some of which can lead to strong magnetar-like remnants. While strong magnetic fields have been shown to affect the dynamics of outflows and angular momentum transport in the remnant, they can also crucially alter the properties of nuclear matter probed in the merger. In this work, we provide a first assessment of the latter, determining the strength of the pressure anisotropy caused by Landau level quantization and the anomalous magnetic moment. To this end, we perform the first numerical relativity simulation with a magnetic polarization tensor and a magnetic-field-dependent equation of state using a new algorithm we present here, which also incorporates a mean-field dynamo model to control the magnetic field strength present in the merger remnant. Our results show that -- in the most optimistic case -- corrections to the anisotropy can be in excess of $10\%$, and are potentially largest in the outer layers of the remnant. This work paves the way for a systematic investigation of these effects.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">We present Bayesian inference results from an extensive injection-recovery campaign to test the validity of three state of the art quasicircular gravitational waveform models: <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">SEOBNRv5PHM</span>, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">IMRPhenomTPHM</span>, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">IMRPhenomXPHM</span>, the latter with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">SpinTaylorT4</span> implementation for its precession dynamics. We analyze 35 strongly precessing binary black hole numerical relativity simulations with all available harmonic content. Ten simulations have a mass ratio of $4:1$ and five, mass ratio of $8:1$. Overall, we find that <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">SEOBNRv5PHM</span> is the most consistent model to numerical relativity, with the majority of true source properties lying within the inferred 90\% credible interval. However, we find that none of the models can reliably infer the true source properties for binaries with mass ratio $8:1$ systems. We additionally conduct inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) consistency tests to determine if our chosen state of the art waveform models infer consistent properties when analysing only the inspiral (low frequency) and ringdown (high frequency) portions of the signal. For the simulations considered in this work, we find that the IMR consistency test depends on the frequency that separates the inspiral and ringdown regimes. For two sensible choices of the cutoff frequency, we report that <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">IMRPhenomXPHM</span> can produce false GR deviations. Meanwhile, we find that <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">IMRPhenomTPHM</span> is the most reliable model under the IMR consistency test. Finally, we re-analyze the same 35 simulations, but this time we incorporate model accuracy into our Bayesian inference. Consistent with the work in Hoy et al. 2024 [arXiv: 2409.19404], we find this approach generally yields more accurate inferred properties for binary black holes with less biases compared to methods that combine model-dependent posterior distributions based on their evidence, or with equal weight.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Gravitational waves from spin-precessing binaries exhibit equatorial asymmetries absent in non-precessing systems, leading to net linear momentum emission and contributing to the remnant's recoil. This effect, recently incorporated into only a few waveform models, is crucial for accurate recoil predictions and improved parameter estimation. We present an upgrade to the SEOBNRv5PHM model -- SEOBNRv5PHM_w/asym -- which includes equatorial asymmetric contributions to the l=m<=4 waveform modes in the co-precessing frame. The model combines post-Newtonian inputs with calibrated amplitude and phase corrections and a phenomenological merger-ringdown description, tuned against 1523 quasi-circular spin-precessing numerical relativity waveforms and single-spin precessing test-body plunging-geodesic waveforms. We find that SEOBNRv5PHM_w/asym improves the agreement with NR waveforms across inclinations, with median unfaithfulness reduced by up to 50% compared to SEOBNRv5PHM, and achieves 30-60% lower unfaithfulness than IMRPhenomXPNR and 76-80% lower than TEOBResumS_Dali. The model significantly improves the prediction of the recoil velocity, reducing the median relative error with numerical relativity from 70% to 1%. Bayesian inference on synthetic injections demonstrates improved recovery of spin orientations and mass parameters, and a reanalysis of GW200129 shows a threefold increase in the spin-precessing Bayes factor, highlighting the importance of these effects for interpreting spin-precessing events.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">The formation of black holes by the gravitational collapse of stars is known to spontaneously excite particle pairs out of the quantum vacuum. For the canonical vacuum state at past null infinity, the expected number of particles received at future null infinity can be obtained in full closed form at sufficiently late times. However, for intermediate times, or for more complicated astrophysical processes (e.g. binary black hole mergers), the problem is technically challenging and has not yet been resolved. We develop here a numerical approach to study scattering problems of massless quantum fields in asymptotically flat spacetimes, based on the hyperboloidal slice method used in numerical relativity and perturbation theory. This promising approach can reach both past and future null infinities, and therefore it has the potential to address the Hawking scattering problem more rigorously than evolution on the usual Cauchy slices. We test this approach with some dynamical toy models in Minkowski using effective potentials that mimic the effects of gravity, and compute the spectrum of particles received at future null infinity. We finally discuss future prospects for applying this framework in more relevant gravitational scenarios.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Accurate modeling of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers is essential for extracting their rich physics. A key detail for understanding the physics of mergers is predicting the precise time when the amplitude of the gravitational wave strain peaks, which can differ significantly among the different harmonic modes. We propose two semi-analytical methods to predict these differences using the same three inputs from Numerical Relativity (NR): the remnant mass and spin and the instantaneous frequency of each mode at its peak amplitude. The first method uses the frequency evolution predicted by the Backwards-One-Body model, while the second models the motion of an equatorial timelike geodesic in the remnant black hole spacetime. We compare our models to the SXS waveform catalog for quasi-circular, non-precessing systems and find excellent agreement for $l = |m|$ modes up to $l=8$, with mean and median differences from NR below 1$M$ in nearly all cases across the parameter space. We compare our results to the differences predicted by leading Effective-One-Body and NR surrogate waveform models and find that in cases corresponding to the largest timing differences, our models can provide significant increases in accuracy.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Systematic errors in detector calibration can bias signal analyses and potentially lead to incorrect interpretations suggesting violations of general relativity. In this study, we investigate how calibration systematics affect black hole (BH) spectroscopy, a technique that uses the quasinormal modes (QNMs) emitted during the ringdown phase of gravitational waves (GWs) to study remnant BHs formed in compact binary coalescences. We simulate a series of physically motivated, tunable calibration errors and use them to intentionally miscalibrate numerical relativity waveforms. We then apply a QNM extraction method -- the rational QNM filter -- to quantify the impact of these calibration errors. We find that current calibration standards (errors within $10\%$ in magnitude and $10^i̧rc$ in phase across the most sensitive frequency range of 20--2000 Hz) are adequate for BH ringdown analyses with existing observations, but insufficient for the accuracy goals of future upgraded and next-generation observatories. Specifically, we show that for events with a high ringdown signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 120$, calibration errors must remain $\lesssim 6\%$ in magnitude and $\lesssim 4^i̧rc$ in phase to avoid introducing biases. While this analysis addresses a particular aspect of BH spectroscopy, the results offer broadly applicable quantitative benchmarks for calibration standards crucial to fully realizing the potential of precision GW astrophysics in the next-generation detector era.</div>
