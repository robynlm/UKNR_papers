                <div class="paper-abstract">We investigate how commonly used parameter definitions in Post-Newtonian (PN) theory compare with those from Numerical Relativity (NR) for binary black hole (BBH) systems. In NR, masses and spins of each companion are measured quasi-locally from apparent horizon geometry, whereas in PN they are attributes of point particles defined via asymptotic matching in body zones. Although these definitions coincide in the infinite-separation limit, they could differ by finite-separation corrections that matter for precision modeling. Working entirely in harmonic gauge, we perform asymptotic matching between each companion's inner zone metric -- obtained from black hole perturbation theory -- and the PN two-body metric, and construct the coordinate transformation that preserves the gauge in the strong field region. We solve perturbatively for the apparent horizon (AH) on a group of harmonic inertial time slice and compute its quasi-local areal mass from the horizon geometry. Then we establish the leading order matching between quasi-local (AH based) and PN (point-particle) parameter definitions in harmonic gauge. We find that on a horizon penetrating harmonic slicing, the AH quasi-local mass agrees with the PN point-particle mass at 1PN order. For generic harmonic slicings that deviate from the horizon penetrating condition by a 1PN order perturbation, the AH mass differs from the PN mass also by a 1PN correction. This parameter matching is crucial for hybridizing PN and NR waveforms and for providing better initial conditions in NR and Cauchy-Characteristic Evolution (CCE) simulations. The framework provides a bridge between different descriptions of BBH systems, and it can be extended to spinning and eccentric cases and more general NR gauges.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Long-term numerical relativity (NR) simulations of binary black hole (BBH) systems in the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) code exhibit an unexpected exponential drift of the center-of-mass (CoM) away from the simulation's origin. In our work, we analyze this phenomenon and demonstrate that it is not a physical effect but rather a manifestation of a gauge artifact. The origin of this drift is the reflection of the gauge waves off the outer boundary of the computational domain. These reflections are introduced by inaccuracies in the gauge boundary condition, specifically, the application of the Sommerfeld condition to the time derivative of the gauge fields. Such an approach fails to completely suppress or correctly absorb the outgoing modes, thereby generating artificial feedback into the simulation. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a modified boundary condition that incorporates an explicit CoM correction source term designed to counteract the CoM motion. Our numerical experiments, performed with the SpEC code, reveal that this new boundary treatment reduces the CoM drift by several orders of magnitude compared to the standard implementation, and does not introduce any unwanted physical artifacts.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">The Backwards-One-Body (BOB) model provides a fully analytical and physically motivated description of the merger-ringdown gravitational radiation emanating from a black hole binary merger. We perform a comprehensive validation of BOB for the dominant $(2,2)$ mode of quasi-circular and non-precessing systems, assessing its accuracy against numerical relativity (NR) simulations, state-of-the-art waveform models, and a sum of quasinormal modes. We demonstrate that BOB most accurately describes the gravitational wave news, achieving accuracy comparable to highly-calibrated Effective-One-Body and NR surrogate models. Because BOB is minimally tuned to NR catalogs, it retains a high level of accuracy in regions of the parameter space sparsely covered by current NR catalogs. BOB yields an analytic link between the amplitude of the fundamental quasinormal mode and the peak amplitude of the News, which we verify to within the errors of a surrogate ringdown model. We identify a flavor of BOB that requires only the remnant mass and spin, yet matches the accuracy of models that fit a sum of many overtones. Lastly, we show that BOB accurately models both the mass and current quadrupole waves for superkick configurations, contrary to a claim in the literature, and explain why that study was not actually implementing BOB as it has been defined. Our findings establish BOB as a powerful tool for gravitational wave analysis, for providing independent tests of NR-calibrated models, and for better understanding the underlying physics of the merger. We provide a companion python package, gwBOB, allowing for the easy construction of various flavors of BOB and comparison to NR waveforms.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">We study the dynamics of isolated closed domain walls with 3+1 numerical relativity. A closed wall shrinks due to its own surface tension, and its surface energy is converted to the kinetic energy, leading to implosion. Then, it can result in the formation of a black hole. First, we focus on spherically symmetric closed domain walls and clarify whether they finally evolve into black holes. Naively, the wall can collapse if its thickness is smaller than the Schwarzschild radius which is determined by the initial surface energy. Our numerical results support this naive criterion for the black hole formation, and indicate that more than 80% of the initial wall energy falls into the black hole. We also investigate the nonspherical collapse by considering the ellipsoidal configurations for the closed domain walls, and it turns out that black holes can be formed even when the ratio of semi-major to semi-minor axes is 1.5.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Dynamical captures of black holes are unique events that provide an exceptional opportunity to probe the strong-field regime of gravitational physics. In this article, we perform numerical relativity simulations to study the events of dynamical capture of two equal-mass non-spinning black holes. We consider a suite of scenarios within a range of initial linear momenta ($p/M=0.095-0.75$) and incidence angles ($Î¸=6.36^iÌ§rc-2.83^iÌ§rc$), and study the emitted Weyl scalar ($\Psi_4$) of each case, as well as the spins and masses of the black holes before and after they merge. We provide a simple analytical model which accurately fits the gravitational-wave emission. We study the dependence of the time-interval between the capture and the merger emissions with respect to the incidence angle, which can be well parametrized by a first-order divergent behavior, allowing to find the angle that separates a scattering event from a dynamical capture. We also find that, in general, the parameters that model the first emission can be well described by linear or exponentially decaying functions in terms of the incidence angle, while others display more complex behaviors that offer valuable insights into the nature of these events.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Binary neutron star mergers provide a laboratory for probing fundamental physics through their gravitational- wave emission and electromagnetic counterparts. In particular, they may allow us to explore signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model in strong-gravity regimes, such as those of dark matter. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of light dark matter, modeled as a minimally coupled scalar field, surrounding a binary neutron star system. Our primary focus is to assess whether the scalar field remains bound to the binary over the late inspiral-merger timescales and to determine its potential impact on observable signatures. We find that, in a range of scenarios, the scalar field forms a common cloud around the binary that does not disperse. At sufficiently high densities, this leads to measurable effects, including a dephasing of the binary inspiral, a less compact post-merger remnant, and suppression of the dynamical ejecta. For densities motivated by astrophysical considerations, however, these effects remain small and are unlikely to be detectable with current or next-generation gravitational-wave observatories.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Light scalar particles arise naturally in many extensions of the Standard Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Gravitational interactions near black holes can trigger the growth of dense scalar configurations that, if sustained during inspiral, alter binary dynamics and imprint signatures on gravitational-wave signals. Detecting such effects would provide a novel probe of fundamental physics and dark matter. Here we develop a semi-analytic waveform model for binaries in scalar environments, validated against numerical relativity simulations, and apply it in a Bayesian analysis of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog. Our results set physically meaningful upper bounds on scalar environments around compact binaries. When superradiance priors are included, we find tentative evidence for such an environment in GW190728 with $\ln B_{\mathrm{vac}}^{\mathrm{env}} \approx 3.5$, which would correspond to the existence of a light scalar field with mass $\sim 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</div>

Using Bayesian inference, we find that the inclusion of a nonlinear quasi-normal mode (220Q), a second-order harmonic predicted by general relativity, is statistically favored over the standard linear model (440 mode) when analyzing the post-merger oscillations. Specifically, models incorporating the 220Q mode yield higher Bayes factors than those including only the linear 440 mode, and produce remnant black hole parameters (mass and spin) more consistent with full numerical relativity simulations. This suggests that nonlinear mode coupling contributes significantly to the ringdown phase, opening a new avenue to probe strong-field gravity beyond linear approximations.</div>

This model, which is a core component of the more extensive WaSABI-C model, consistently assembles all available first-order self-force and post-Newtonian results through a hybridization procedure without any tuning to numerical relativity, making it particularly suited for intermediate to extreme mass ratios. For almost all masses and primary spins, the resulting hybrid model significantly improves the faithfulness of both post-Newtonian and adiabatic self-force waveforms considered separately. We provide detailed comparisons with 50 simulations from the SXS catalog with mass ratios ranging from 1 to 15 and primary spins ranging from -0.8 to 0.8. The hybrid model improves the median mismatch against numerical relativity waveforms by a factor of 2000 with respect to adiabatic waveforms and 40 with respect to post-Newtonian waveforms. The mismatches are comparable to those obtained from the SEOBNRv5EHM model in the quasicircular limit over most of the parameter space covered by NR simulations.</div>

Rev. Lett. 130, 241402 (2023)]. In this paper, we extend that model to allow for a slowly spinning primary black hole and a generic, precessing spin on the secondary object, restricting to the case of small misalignment between the primary spin and the orbital angular momentum. We demonstrate excellent agreement between our waveforms and fully nonlinear numerical relativity simulations for mass ratios $q\gtrsim 5$ and primary spins $|hÌ§i_1|\lesssim 0.1$ and arbitrary secondary spin $hÌ§i_2 \lesssim 1$. In particular we present the re-summed 1PAT1R waveform model, which significantly improves the accuracy of the original 1PAT1 waveforms for comparable masses and increasing primary spin.

                <div class="paper-abstract">We present numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers incorporating neutrino flavor transformations triggered by fast flavor instability, quantum many-body effects, or potential beyond standard model physics. In both long-lived and short-lived remnant scenarios, neutrino flavor conversions modify species-dependent neutrino luminosities and mean energies, and drive the matter towards more neutron rich conditions. They produce up to $300%$ more neutron rich ejecta and significantly boost the r-process yields, especially in low-density, near-equatorial outflows. We identify regions unstable to fast flavor instabilities and find that these instabilities persist despite flavor conversions. We further test the sensitivity to the equilibration timescale of the flavor conversions, finding that slower flavor conversions can interact with thermodynamic equilibration, and increase the neutron richness of the ejecta. Flavor conversions may also contribute to stronger gravitational wave and neutrino emissions, pointing to a correlation between neutrino transport and merger dynamics. These results highlight the potential impact of flavor conversions while motivating future work to improve on theoretical understanding of flavor instabilities in global simulations.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">The rich phenomenology of binary neutron star mergers offers a unique opportunity to test general relativity, investigate matter at supranuclear densities, and learn more about the origin of heavy elements. As multi-messenger sources, they emit both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation across several frequency bands. The interpretation of these signals relies heavily on accurate numerical-relativity simulations that incorporate the relevant microphysical processes. Using the latest updates of the BAM code, we perform general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star mergers with two different spin configurations. We adopt a state-of-the-art equation of state based on relativistic mean-field theory developed for dense matter in neutron star mergers. To capture both dynamical ejecta and secular outflows from magnetic and neutrino-driven winds, we evolve the systems up to $\sim 100\ \rm ms$ after the merger at considerably high resolution with a grid spacing of $Î” x \approx 93\ \rm m$ across the neutron stars. Our results show that the non-spinning configuration undergoes a more violent merger, producing more ejecta with lower electron fraction and higher velocities, while the spinning configuration forms a larger disk due to its higher angular momentum. Although the initial magnetic field amplification within $\lesssim 10\ \rm ms$ after merger is similar in both systems, the non-spinning system reaches stronger magnetic fields and higher energies at later times. For a detailed view of the multi-messenger observables, we extract the gravitational-wave signal and compute nucleosynthesis yields, the expected kilonova and afterglow light curves from our ejecta profiles.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnant are a cheap alternative to 3D simulations. To maintain realism for secular timescales, simulations must avoid accumulated errors from drifts in conserved quantities and artificial heating, and they must model turbulent transport in a way that remains plausible throughout the evolution. It is also crucial to avoid numerical artifacts due to the polar coordinate axis singularity. Methods that behave well near the axis often break flux-conservative form of the hydrodynamic equations, resulting in significant drifts in conserved quantities. We present a flux-conservative scheme that maintains smoothness near the axis without sacrificing conservative formulation of the equations or incurring drifts in conserved global quantities. We compare the numerical performance of different treatments of the hydrodynamic equations when evolving a hypermassive neutron star resembling the remnant of a BNS merger. These simulations demonstrate that the new scheme combines the axis smoothness of non-conservative methods with the mass and angular momentum conservation of other conservative methods on $\sim$ $10^2$ ms timescales of viscous and neutrino-driven evolution. Because fluid profiles remain smooth in the remnant interior, it is possible to remove artificial heating by evolving the entropy density. We show how physical heating and cooling terms can be easily calculated from source terms of the conservative evolution variables and demonstrate our implementation. Finally, we discuss and implement improvements to the effective viscosity scheme to better model the effect of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities as the remnant evolves.</div>

The code solves the full set of Einstein equations coupled to a relativistic, magnetized fluid with an M1 neutrino radiation scheme using advanced techniques, including adaptive mesh and large eddy simulation techniques, to achieve high accuracy. The Simflowny platform generates the code from a high-level specification of the computational system, producing code that runs with either the SAMRAI or AMReX infrastructure. The choice of AMReX enables compilation and execution on GPUs, running an order of magnitude faster than on CPUs at the node level. We validate the code against benchmark tests, reproducing previous results obtained with the SAMRAI infrastructure, and demonstrate its capabilities with simulations of neutron stars employing realistic tabulated equations of state. Resolution studies clearly demonstrate convergence faster than second order in the grid spacing. Scaling tests reveal excellent strong and weak scaling performance when running on GPUs. The goal of the code is to provide a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of compact objects within multi-messenger astrophysics.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">With the upcoming third-generation gravitational-wave detectors comes the need to build complete, faithful, and fast waveform models for asymmetric-mass-ratio compact binaries. Most efforts within the self-force community have focused on modeling these binaries' inspiral regime, but for ground-based detectors the systems' final merger can represent the dominant part of the signal. Recent work by three of us has extended the multiscale self-force framework through the transition-to-plunge and merger-ringdown regimes for nonspinning binaries. In this paper, we generalize the next-to-next-to-leading-order transition-to-plunge waveform model to include the spin of the primary black hole. We also improve the construction of composite inspiral-transition waveform models by performing a change of variables on the binary's mechanical phase space during the transition to plunge. We provide detailed discussions of our numerical implementation and comparisons with numerical relativity simulations.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Numerical relativity (NR) enables the study of physics in strong and dynamical gravitational fields and provides predictions for the gravitational-wave signals produced by merging black holes. Despite the impressive accuracy of modern codes, the resulting waveforms inevitably contain numerical uncertainties. Quantifying these uncertainties is important, especially for studies probing subdominant or nonlinear effects around the merger and ringdown. This paper describes a flexible Gaussian-process model for the numerical uncertainties in all the spherical-harmonic waveform modes across a state-of-the-art catalog of NR waveforms and a highly efficient procedure for sampling the posteriors of quasinormal mode models without the need for expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo. The Gaussian-process model is used to define a likelihood function which allows many Bayesian data analysis techniques - already widely used in the analysis of experimental gravitational wave data - to be applied to NR waveforms as well. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by applying it to the analysis of quasinormal modes in Cauchy-characteristic evolved waveforms.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">In the past few decades, the waveform community has made advances in producing waveforms that span the inspiral-merger-ringdown of comparable-mass-ratio black hole binaries using advances in post-Newtonian and numerical relativity (NR) theory along with state-of-the-art gravitational wave models. Current methods in NR have shown progress towards producing stable simulations reaching mass ratios of 1:100; however, the computational cost becomes prohibitively expensive as the mass ratio and the length of the simulation increases. Meanwhile, the gravitational self-force (GSF) community has developed waveform models that not only generate extreme mass ratio inspiral waveforms, but also generate near-equal-mass-ratio waveforms with high fidelity. To assess the limits of both the GSF and NR waveforms and alleviate the computational costs of NR, we present hybridized GSF-NR waveforms for non-spinning binary black hole systems in which GSF provides the inspiral, and NR the merger and ringdown. The hybrid waveforms are generated from a set of 68 non-spinning NR waveforms from the SXS catalogue with mass ratios spanning 1:1 to 1:20 and include the (2,2), (2,1), (3,3), (3,2), (4,4), (4,3), and (5,5) spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes. In this paper, we will highlight a selection of these hybrid waveforms and examine the error in the hybridization procedure. We will investigate the impact of subdominant modes on the accuracy of the hybrid waveforms by performing mismatch comparisons with surrogate models. To address the feasibility of hybridizing GSF inspirals with short, high-mass ratio NR waveforms, thereby alleviating computational costs, we will discuss the relationship between mass ratio and the placement of the matching window, which can be used to predict the necessary and optimal number of NR cycles that contribute to the hybrid waveform.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a compelling dark matter candidate and a unique probe of small-scale cosmological fluctuations. Their formation is usually attributed to large positive curvature perturbations, which collapse upon Hubble re-entry during radiation domination. In this work we investigate instead the role of negative curvature perturbations, corresponding to the growth of primordial void (PV) like regions. Using numerical relativity simulations, we show that sufficiently deep PV can undergo a nonlinear rebounce at the center, generating an effective overdensity that eventually collapses into a PBH. We determine the critical threshold for this process for a variety of equations of state, and demonstrate that the resulting black holes obey a scaling relation analogous to the standard overdensity case. These results establish primordial voids as a novel channel for PBH formation and highlight their potential impact on PBH abundances and cosmological signatures.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">In studies of binary black hole (BBH) mergers in eccentric orbits, the mean anomaly, traditionally regarded as less significant than eccentricity, has been thought to encode only the orbital phase, leading to the assumption that it exerts minimal influence on the dynamics of eccentric mergers. In a previous investigation, we identified consistent oscillations in dynamical quantities peak luminosity $L_{\text{peak}}$, remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$, spin $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$, and recoil velocity $V_{\text{rem}}$ in relation to the initial eccentricity $e_0$. These oscillations are associated with integer orbital cycles within a phenomenological framework. In this paper, we aim to explore the underlying physical nature of these oscillations through gravitational waveforms. Our examination of remnant mass and spin reveals that while the initial ADM mass $M_{\mathrm{ADM}}$ and orbital angular momentum $L_0$ exhibit gradual variations with $e_0$, the radiated energy $E_{\text{rad}}$ and angular momentum $L_{\text{rad}}$ display oscillatory patterns akin to those observed in $M_{\text{rem}}$ and $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$. By decomposing the waveforms into three distinct phases inspiral, late inspiral to merger, and ringdown, we demonstrate that these oscillations persist across all phases, suggesting a common origin. Through a comparative analysis of $E_{\text{rad}}$ and $L_{\text{rad}}$ derived from numerical relativity (NR), post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms, and orbital-averaged PN fluxes during the inspiral phase, we identify the initial mean anomaly $l_0$ as the source of the observed oscillations. ...</div>

The waveforms produced by these simulations have a number of applications in gravitational-wave detection and inference. In this work, we revisit the accuracy of the waveforms produced by the Spectral Einstein Code. Motivated by the wide range of waveform applications, we propose and explore three accuracy metrics between simulation resolutions: (i) the generalized frequency-weighted mismatch, (ii) the relative amplitude difference, and (iii) the phase difference at different times. We find that numerical errors accumulate over the binary evolution, but the error is not intrinsically larger during the latest, more dynamical stages. Studying errors across the parameter space, we identify a positive correlation between both the mismatch and the phase difference with precessing spin, but little correlation with aligned spin or eccentricity. Lastly, amplitude and phases differences are symmetric upon exchanging resolutions across the catalog, suggesting that there is no systematic error.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">While the majority of gravitational wave (GW) events observed by the LIGO and Virgo detectors are consistent with mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) on quasi-circular orbits, some events are also consistent with non-zero orbital eccentricity, indicating that the binaries could have formed via dynamical interactions. Moreover, there may be GW events which show support for spin-precession, eccentricity, or both. In this work, we study the interplay of spins and eccentricity on the parameter estimation of GW signals from BBH mergers. We inject eccentric signals with no spins, aligned spins, and precessing spins using hybrids, TEOBResumS-DALI, and new Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations, respectively, and study the biases in the posteriors of source parameters when these signals are recovered with a quasi-circular precessing-spin waveform model, as opposed to an aligned-spin eccentric waveform model. We find significant biases in the source parameters, such as chirp mass and spin-precession ($hÌ§i_p$), when signals from highly-eccentric BBHs are recovered with a quasi-circular waveform model. Moreover, we find that for signals with both eccentricity and spin-precession effects, Bayes factor calculations confirm that an eccentric, aligned-spin model is preferred over a quasi-circular precessing-spin model. Our study highlights the complex nature of GW signals from eccentric, precessing-spin binaries and the need for readily usable inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric, spin-precessing waveform models for unbiased parameter estimation.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Recent observations of compact binary systems have provided evidence for black holes with masses below standard expectations. When paired with neutron stars (NSs), such low-mass black holes (BHs) have the potential to be detected by future multimessenger campaigns and could unveil unknown features of the BH population in the universe. Given the importance of accurate models for matched-filtering searches and Bayesian parameter estimation in discoveries of this sort, attention has renewed on the limitations of low-mass NSBH merger models and on the downstream impact of such limitations on gravitational-wave data analysis. Previous numerical relativity (NR) studies have revealed discrepancies in the predicted merger time, as well as more general mismatches and dephasing between phenomenological models and high-resolution simulations. The simulation presented here was motivated by these findings and illustrates how publicly available tools can be applied to this specific science case, towards informing next-generation, more refined gravitational-wave and kilonovae models. Here, we summarize the setup of a high-resolution general relativistic hydrodynamics simulation of an equal-mass NSBH system performed entirely with public codes (Einstein Toolkit and FUKA) and a finite-temperature equation of state. The results we show include the $(\ell,m)=(2,2)$ strain and 2D snapshots of the system undergoing tidal disruption and early postmerger disk formation. The system evolved for $\sim 4$ orbits while the $L_2$ norm of the Hamiltonian constraint remained below $6\times10^{-7}$ throughout the inspiral prior to growing near merger time.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Numerical relativity (NR) provides the most accurate waveforms for comparable-mass binary black holes but becomes prohibitively expensive for increasingly asymmetric mass ratios. Point-particle black hole perturbation theory (ppBHPT), which expands the Einstein equations in the small-mass-ratio limit, offers a computationally efficient alternative but is expected to break down in the comparable-mass regime because it neglects nonlinear effects. Nonetheless, several recent studies have shown that ppBHPT can model non-spinning binaries with high accuracy when supplemented by simple calibrations or a first post-adiabatic (PA) correction. Here we assess the applicability of ppBHPT to quasi-circular binaries with a spinning primary by comparing waveform amplitudes, orbital frequencies, and orbital phases. We find that spin effects in ppBHPT waveforms (without additional spin information beyond adiabatic order) are in surprisingly close agreement with the corresponding NR calculation (outperforming some post-Newtonian models) over the last $\approx 20$ orbital cycles. This suggests that, after incorporating higher-order corrections into ppBHPT waveforms in the non-spinning limit -- via second-order self-force results or semi-analytical fits -- only modest spin-dependent adjustments may be required to achieve NR-faithful ppBHPT waveforms. We also show that combining non-spinning NR information with adiabatic ppBHPT can provide a reasonably accurate inspiral waveform for spins $Ï‡ \lesssim 0.5$ mass ratios $q \gtrsim 5$.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Mounting evidence indicates that some of the gravitational wave signals observed by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observatories might arise from eccentric compact object binaries, increasing the urgency for accurate waveform models for such systems. While for non-eccentric binaries, surrogate models are efficient and accurate, the additional features due to eccentricity have posed a challenge. In this letter, we present a novel method for decomposing eccentric numerical relativity waveforms which makes them amenable to surrogate modelling techniques. We parameterize the inspiral in the radial phase domain, factoring out eccentricity-induced dephasing and thus enhancing compressibility and accuracy. This is combined with a second surrogate for the merger-ringdown in the time-domain and a novel technique to take advantage of the approximate periodicity with radial oscillations during the inspiral. We apply this procedure to the $(2,2)$ mode for non-spinning black hole binaries, and demonstrate that the resulting surrogate, NRSurE_q4NoSpin_22, is able to faithfully reproduce the underlying numerical relativity waveforms, with maximum mismatches of $5\times10^{-4}$ and median mismatches of $2\times10^{-5}$. This technique paves the way for high-accuracy parameter estimation with eccentric models, a key ingredient for astrophysical inference and tests of general relativity.</div>

Specific applications include studies of primordial black hole formation and the robustness of inflation. Here we adopt a toy model previously used in asymptotically flat spacetimes to show that, for given values of the over-density and the mean curvature, solutions to the Hamiltonian constraint need not exist, and if they do exist they are not unique. Specifically, pairs of solutions exist on two branches, corresponding to strong-field and weak-field solutions, that join at a maximum beyond which solutions cease to exist. As a result, there is a limit to the extent to which an over-density can be balanced by intrinsic rather than extrinsic curvature on the initial slice. Even below this limit, iterative methods to construct initial data may converge to solutions on either one of the two branches, depending on the starting guess, leading to potentially inconsistent physical results in the evolution.</div>

By detecting and evaluating community structures from data on substantial interactions (defined as prolonged co-presence in the same virtual space), we found that Social VR platforms tend to host numerous, relatively small communities characterized by strong internal cohesion and limited inter-community connections. This finding contrasts with the large-scale, broadly connected community structures typically observed in conventional Social Networking Services (SNS). Furthermore, we identified a user segment capable of mediating between communities, despite these users not necessarily having numerous direct connections. We term this user segment `community hoppers' and discuss their characteristics.

In order to extract such constraints, gravitational waveform models need to be calibrated to accurate numerical relativity simulations of the late inspiral and merger. In this work, we take an essential step toward classifying the error and potential systematics in current generation numerical relativity simulations of merging binary neutron stars. To this end, we perform a direct comparison of two codes (FIL, SpEC), which differ in many aspects, including the numerical methods and discretizations used and equations solved. We find that despite these different approaches, the codes are -- within current numerical resolution bounds -- fully consistent, and broadly comparable in cost for a given accuracy level. Our results indicate that the error in the waveforms is primarily dominated by the hydrodynamic evolution, consistent with earlier findings in the literature.

                <div class="paper-abstract">Newtonian and post-Newtonian (PN) calculations indicate that the phenomenology of eccentric binary black hole (BBH) merger waveforms is significantly more complex than that of their quasi-circular counterparts. Each spherical harmonic mode of the radiation can be further decomposed into several eccentricity-induced components, referred to as eccentric harmonics. Unlike the (cumulative) spherical harmonic modes, these constituent eccentric harmonics exhibit monotonically time-varying amplitudes and frequencies. However, these eccentric harmonics are not directly accessible in numerical relativity (NR) simulations or current eccentric waveform models. Using the recently developed data-driven framework gwMiner, which combines singular value decomposition, input from post-Newtonian theory, and signal processing techniques, we extract eccentric harmonics from eccentric, aligned-spin waveforms for six different spherical harmonic modes: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4). We demonstrate that the phase (frequency) of each eccentric harmonic takes the form $j\,\phi_{\ell,m,Î»} + \phi_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$ ($j\,f_{\ell,m,Î»} + f_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$), where $\phi_{\ell,m,Î»}$ ($f_{\ell,m,Î»}$) corresponds to the secular orbital phase (frequency), and $\phi_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$ ($f_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$) is an additional contribution that depends solely on the eccentricity. We further find that $\phi_{\ell,m,Î»}$ is the same across different spherical harmonic modes $(\ell, m)$, whereas the eccentric correction term $\phi_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$ scales with $\ell$. Using effective-one-body dynamics, we further show that $\phi_{\ell,m,Î»}$ is nothing but the relativistic anomaly and $\phi_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$ is related to the precession advances.</div>

It is now a viable new option for modelling out-of-equilibrium effects in fluids, and has attracted wide attention in its potential applications to astrophysical systems. In this work, we present the first non-linear numerical simulation of spherically symmetric neutron stars using the BDNK formulation under the Cowling approximation. Using a simplified equation of state, we show that stable evolutions can be constructed within a restricted parameter space up to the simulation time we explored. From these simulations, we analyse the frequency content of the quasi-normal modes and the decay rate of the fundamental mode. This analysis serves as a first step towards constructing a fully consistent model of neutron stars using the BDNK formulation.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">The demand for long and accurate gravitational waveforms is increasing as we prepare for the next generation of detectors and seek to improve current waveform models. However, numerical relativity waveforms, while highly accurate, are often too short for these applications due to their high computational cost. Hybrid waveforms, which stitch together gravitational wave signals from different modeling approaches, provide a way to generate complete inspiral-merger-ringdown signals. While hybridization is well-established for aligned-spin systems, precession introduces additional complexities due to gauge ambiguities, frame dependence, or spin dynamics. Here we study the challenges associated with alignment of precessing waveforms and present a systematic approach for constructing hybrid waveforms of precessing quasi-circular systems. Our approach relies on minimal assumptions about the merger waveforms and employs the quadrupole-aligned frame to mitigate mode-mixing. Our method is designed to be robust and broadly applicable, imposing minimal constraints on the input waveforms. This framework expands the applicability of hybridization techniques, facilitating flexible hybrid construction for parameter estimation, model calibration, and gravitational-wave data analysis.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.</div>

We analyze merger waves from comparable-mass and extreme-mass-ratio binaries, obtained from numerical relativity and black-hole perturbation theory, respectively, and argue that they are dominated by the prompt wave emissions as the black holes collide. This signal, which we refer to as the direct wave, is modulated by the plunging motion and selectively screened by the gravitational potential of the remnant black hole. The direct wave typically exhibits a time-dependent frequency and decay rate, but for high-spin remnants $(\gtrsim0.7)$ the ergosphere renders it mode-like, with a quasi-stable instantaneous oscillation frequency close to the superradiant frequency. We further estimate its detectability in a GW150914-like system and find that the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed $\sim 10$ with the current ground-based detector network. Our results therefore identify the direct wave as a robust observable for analyzing black hole ringdowns in current and future gravitational wave events.</div>

Forming 10^9 Solar Mass SMBHs by z=6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli2007,Lousto2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Population III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by approximately 20-30% by z=6 and creates a population of off-nuclear (``wandering'') BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets approximately 0.1'' and line-of-sight velocity shifts approximately 10^2-10^3 km\s in a few-percent of high-redshift quasars.

                <div class="paper-abstract">We model the short gamma-ray bursts (GRB) 090510 as the product of a magnetized neutron star (NS) binary merger. Accounting for the NS critical mass constraint given by the mass of PSR J0952--0607, we infer that GRB 090510 was a highly-magnetized NS-NS merger that left as remnant a Kerr black hole (BH) of $2.4 M_\odot$ with a low-mass accretion disk. The gamma-ray precursor is powered by the magnetic energy released during the merger of the NSs. The prompt emission originates at the transparency of an ultra-relativistic $e^+e^-$ pair-plasma produced by the overcritical electric field induced by the rotating strong magnetic field around the merged object before it reaches the critical mass, the GeV emission by the extractable energy of the newborn BH, and the X-ray afterglow by accretion onto it. We derive the masses of the merging NSs, their magnetic fields, the BH mass, spin, and irreducible mass, the strength of the magnetic field, the disk mass, and obtain an estimate of the gravitational-wave emission during the merger phase preceding the prompt short GRB emission. The inferred parameters agree with up-to-date numerical relativity simulations, confirming that strong magnetic fields above $10^{14}$ G develop in NS-NS mergers and that mergers leading to a central BH remnant have low-mass disks of $\sim 10^{-2} M_\odot$. We also advance the possibility that quasi-period oscillations of tens of Hz of frequency due to Lense-Thirring precession of the matter surrounding the merged object before BH formation can explain the successive spikes following the prompt emission peak.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">The binary black hole signal GW250114, the loudest gravitational wave detected to date, offers a unique opportunity to test Einstein's general relativity (GR) in the high-velocity, strong-gravity regime and probe whether the remnant conforms to the Kerr metric. Upon perturbation, black holes emit a spectrum of damped sinusoids with specific, complex frequencies. Our analysis of the post-merger signal shows that at least two quasi-normal modes are required to explain the data, with the most damped remaining statistically significant for about one cycle. We probe the remnant's Kerr nature by constraining the spectroscopic pattern of the dominant quadrupolar ($\ell = m = 2$) mode and its first overtone to match the Kerr prediction to tens of percent at multiple post-peak times. The measured mode amplitudes and phases agree with a numerical-relativity simulation having parameters close to GW250114. By fitting a parameterized waveform that incorporates the full inspiral-merger-ringdown sequence, we constrain the fundamental $(\ell=m=4)$ mode to tens of percent and bound the quadrupolar frequency to within a few percent of the GR prediction. We perform a suite of tests -- spanning inspiral, merger, and ringdown -- finding constraints that are comparable to, and in some cases 2-3 times more stringent than those obtained by combining dozens of events in the fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. These results constitute the most stringent single-event verification of GR and the Kerr nature of black holes to date, and outline the power of black-hole spectroscopy for future gravitational-wave observations.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">When numerically solving Einstein's equations for binary black holes (BBH), we must find initial data on a three-dimensional spatial slice by solving constraint equations. The construction of initial data is a multi-step process, in which one first chooses freely specifiable data that define a conformal background and impose boundary conditions. Then, one numerically solves elliptic equations and calculates physical properties such as horizon masses, spins, and asymptotic quantities from the solution. To achieve desired properties, one adjusts the free data in an iterative ``control'' loop. Previous methods for these iterative adjustments rely on Newtonian approximations and do not allow the direct control of total energy and angular momentum of the system, which becomes particularly important in the study of hyperbolic encounters of black holes. Using the $\text{SpECTRE}$ code, we present a novel parameter control procedure that benefits from Broyden's method in all controlled quantities. We use this control scheme to minimize drifts in bound orbits and to enable the construction of hyperbolic encounters. We see that the activation of off-diagonal terms in the control Jacobian gives us better efficiency when compared to the simpler implementation in the Spectral Einstein Code ($\text{SpEC}$). We demonstrate robustness of the method across extreme configurations, including spin magnitudes up to $Ï‡ = 0.9999$, mass ratios up to $q = 50$, and initial separations up to $D_0 = 1000M$. Given the open-source nature of $\text{SpECTRE}$, this is the first time a parameter control scheme for constructing bound and unbound BBH initial data is available to the numerical-relativity community.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">The ringdown phase of the binary black hole (BBH) merger provides a clean and direct probe of strong-field gravity and tests of the nature of black holes. The quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies in modified gravity theories, as well as their amplitudes and phases, might deviate from the Kerr ones in general relativity. Charged black holes (BHs) in Einstein-Maxwell theory provide an excellent example of a beyond-Kerr solution with direct astrophysical and fundamental physics applications. In this work, we extract the ringdown mode amplitudes and phases for charged BBH mergers based on fully general relativistic simulations with charge-to-mass ratio up to 0.3. Our results suggest that even though the inspiral phase of charged BBHs can be significantly accelerated or decelerated, the ringdown mode excitation only changes mildly. We further explore the charge detectability with the ringdown-only signal for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We find that previous studies may have overestimated the charge detectability and including higher modes in charged waveforms is necessary for future ringdown analysis. This constitutes the first such analysis based on waveforms generated by numerical relativity simulations of charged BHs in full Einstein-Maxwell theory.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">The effective one-body (EOB) theory provides an innovative framework for analyzing the dynamics of binary systems, as articulated by Hamilton's equations. This paper investigates a self-consistent EOB theory specifically tailored for the dynamics of such systems. Our methodology begins by emphasizing how to effectively utilize the metrics derived from scattering angles in the analysis of binary black hole mergers. We then construct an effective Hamiltonian and formulate a decoupled, variable-separated Teukolsky-like equation for $Ïˆ^B_4$. Furthermore, we present the formal solution to this equation, detailing the energy flux, radiation-reaction force (RRF), and waveforms for the ``plus" and ``cross" modes generated by spinless binaries. Finally, we carry out numerical calculations using the EOB theory and compare the results with numerical relativity (NR) data from the SXS collaboration. The results indicate that to the innermost stable circular orbit, the binding energy -- angular momentum relation differs from the NR results by less than $5$\textperthousand, with a larger mass ratio yielding better agreement.</div>

We construct fits using the leading-order post-Newtonian (PN) dependence on intrinsic parameters, replacing the PN velocity with fit coefficients. We compare these to polynomial fits in symmetric mass ratio and spin. We analyze $(\ell, m)$ modes with $\ell \leq 4$ from late inspiral ($t = -500M$ relative to the $(2,2)$ peak) to post-merger ($t = 40M$). For nonspinning systems, the $(2,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(3,3)$ modes retain the leading-order PN dependence on mass ratio throughout the merger. Higher-order modes deviate from the PN dependence only near and after the merger, where polynomial fits of degree $N \leq 3$ can capture the amplitude behavior up to $40M$. For aligned-spin systems at fixed mass ratio, the $(2,1)$ mode retains its PN spin dependence, while the $(3,2)$ and $(4,3)$ modes exhibit a quadratic spin dependence near merger. The PN-inspired fits lose accuracy with increasing mass ratio, particularly near merger. Results broadly agree across catalogs, though discrepancies appear in the $(3,1)$, $(4,2)$, and $(4,1)$ modes, likely from resolution differences. Our results clarify the extent to which PN structure persists in mode amplitudes and show that simple polynomial models can capture strong-field behavior near merger, enabling efficient and interpretable waveform modeling in this regime.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">High-fidelity gravitational waveform models are essential for realizing the scientific potential of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories. While highly accurate, state-of-the-art models often rely on extensive phenomenological calibrations to numerical relativity (NR) simulations for the late-inspiral and merger phases, which can limit physical insight and extrapolation to regions where NR data is sparse. To address this, we introduce the Spinning Effective-to-Backwards One Body (SEBOB) formalism, a hybrid approach that combines the well-established Effective-One-Body (EOB) framework with the analytically-driven Backwards-One-Body (BOB) model, which describes the merger-ringdown from first principles as a perturbation of the final remnant black hole. We present two variants building on the state-of-the-art $\text{SEOBNRv5HM}$ model: $\text{seobnrv5_nrnqc_bob}$, which retains standard NR-calibrated non-quasi-circular (NQC) corrections and attaches a BOB-based merger-ringdown; and a more ambitious variant, $\text{seobnrv5_bob}$, which uses BOB to also inform the NQC corrections, thereby reducing reliance on NR fitting and enabling higher-order ($\mathcal{C}^2$) continuity by construction. Implemented in the open-source $\text{NRPy}$ framework for optimized C-code generation, the SEBOB model is transparent, extensible, and computationally efficient. By comparing our waveforms to a large catalog of NR simulations, we demonstrate that SEBOB yields accuracies comparable to the highly-calibrated $\text{SEOBNRv5HM}$ model, providing a viable pathway towards more physically motivated and robust waveform models</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Black hole spectroscopy is an important pillar when studying gravitational waves from black holes and enables tests of general relativity. Most of the gravitational-wave signals observed over the last decade originate from binary black hole systems. Binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star systems are rarer but of particular interest for the next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. These events offer the exciting possibility of studying matter effects on the ringdown of "dirty black holes". In this work, we ask the question: Does matter matter? Using numerical-relativity, we simulate a wide range of collapsing neutron stars producing matter environments, both in isolated scenarios and in binary mergers. Qualitatively, the resulting ringdown signals can be classified into "clean", "modified", and "distorted" cases, depending on the amount of matter that is present. We apply standard strategies for extracting quasinormal modes of clean signals, using both theory-agnostic and theory-specific assumptions. Even in the presence of matter, possible modifications of quasinormal modes seem to be dominated by ringdown modeling systematics. We find that incorporating multiple quasinormal modes allows one to drastically reduce mismatches and errors in estimating the final black hole mass at early times. If not treated carefully, deviations in the fundamental quasinormal mode might artificially be overestimated and falsely attributed to the presence of matter or violations of general relativity.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">GW200105_162426 is the first neutron star-black hole merger to be confidently confirmed through either gravitational-wave or electromagnetic observations. Although initially analyzed after detection, the event has recently gained renewed attention following a study, Morras et al. (2025), that employed a post-Newtonian inspiral-only waveform model and reported strong evidence for orbital eccentricity. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of GW200105 using state-of-the-art effective-one-body waveform models. Importantly, we present the first study of this event utilizing a physically complete model that incorporates both orbital eccentricity and spin precession across the full inspiral, merger, and ringdown stages, along with higher-order gravitational wave modes. Our results support the presence of eccentricity in the signal, with zero eccentricity excluded from $99%$ credible interval, but yield a mass ratio closer to the original LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analysis, differing from the findings of Morras et al. (2025). Additionally, similar to previous eccentric-only analysis Planas et al. (2025), we observe a multimodal structure in the eccentricity posterior distribution. We conduct targeted investigations to understand the origin of this multimodality and complement our analysis with numerical relativity simulations to examine how the inclusion of eccentricity impacts the merger dynamics.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Recent advances in post-Minkowskian (PM) gravity provide new avenues for the high precision modelling of compact binaries. In conjunction with the Effective One Body (EOB) formalism, highly accurate PM informed models of binary black holes on scattering trajectories have emerged. Several complementary approaches currently exist, in particular the SEOB-PM model, the $w_{\rm eob}$ framework and the recent LEOB approach. These models incorporate PM results in fundamentally different ways, employing distinct resummation schemes and gauge choices. Notably, both SEOB-PM and LEOB have been used to compute gravitational waves of bound systems, showing excellent agreement with numerical relativity (NR). The essential component to all of the models is the EOB mass-shell condition describing the dynamics of the two-body spacetime. In this work we will investigate how this mass-shell condition is constructed, paying particular attention to the impact of gauge choices and how they interact with different resummation schemes, showing that there is a strong dependence on both coordinate choice and EOB gauge. For the region of parameter space considered, we find that the best performing gauges coincide with the choices made in SEOB-PM and $w_{eob}$, with other choices exhibiting worse performance. The case of spinning black holes is also considered, where the current techniques for spinning EOB-PM are reviewed and compared. We also introduce a new gauge based upon the centrifugal radius, which improves upon previous models, particularly for large and negative spins. This offers a promising avenue for further resummation of spin information within the EOB-PM framework.</div>

First, we validate our implementation in one-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamics tests, i.e., a simple wave and shock tube test, which have analytic solutions. We demonstrate that the fourth-order convergence is achieved for the smooth flow, which cannot be achieved in our original second-order accurate finite-volume Riemann solver. We also show that our new solver is robust for the strong shock wave emergence problem. Second, we validate the implementation in a dynamical spacetime by demonstrating that {\tt SACRA-MPI} perfectly preserves the $Ï€$-symmetry without imposing the $Ï€$-symmetry in a short-term ($\sim 20~{\rm ms}$ in the inspiral and subsequent post-merger phase) non-spinning equal-mass binary neutron star merger simulations. Finally, we quantify the accuracy of $\approx 28$ cycles inspiral gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers by conducting a resolution study with $\approx 78, 94$, $118$, and $135$ m. We find that the fourth-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.1\pm{0.05}$--$2.4\pm{0.27}$, i.e., slightly evolving with time, in the inspiral gravitational wave phase, while the second-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.0\pm{0.5}$. The residual phase error towards the continuum limit at the merger is $0.27\pm 0.07$ rad and $0.58\pm 0.22$ rad out of a total phase of $\approx 176$ rad, respectively, for the fourth- and second-order accurate Riemann solver.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">We describe a series of laboratory experiments that can be performed with the Quantum Control apparatus sold by TeachSpin, which uses pulsed NMR techniques to observe the precession of protons in a liquid water sample. With a uniform background magnetic field of 21 Gauss, the protons precess at about 90 kHz, yielding numerous relatively simple observations and measurements that are well suited to undergraduate physics teaching labs. Our goal in this paper is to document some of these experiments in detail, thereby making it easier for instructors to choose material that is best suited for their curricula.</div>
