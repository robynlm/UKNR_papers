                <div class="paper-abstract">We present a comprehensive assessment of multiparameter tests of general relativity (GR) in the inspiral regime of compact binary coalescences using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our analysis is based on an extensive set of simulated gravitational wave signals, including both general relativistic and non-GR sources, injected into zero-noise data colored by the noise power spectral densities of the LIGO and Virgo detectors at their designed sensitivities. We evaluate the performance of PCA-based methods in the context of two established frameworks: TIGER and FTI. For GR-consistent signals, we find that PCA enables stringent constraints on potential deviations from GR, even in the presence of multiple free parameters. Applying the method to simulated signals that explicitly violate GR, we demonstrate that PCA is effective at identifying such deviations. We further test the method using numerical relativity waveforms of eccentric binary black hole systems and show that missing physical effects-such as orbital eccentricity-can lead to apparent violations of GR if not properly included in the waveform models used for analysis. Finally, we apply our PCA-based test to selected real gravitational-wave events from GWTC-3, including GW190814 and GW190412. We present joint constraints from selected binary black hole events in GWTC-3, finding that the 90% credible bound on the most informative PCA parameter is $0.03^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ in the TIGER framework and $-0.01^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ in the FTI framework, both of which are consistent with GR. These results highlight the sensitivity and robustness of the PCA-based approach and demonstrate its readiness for application to future observational data from the fourth observing runs of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">We present a framework to propagate to null infinity gravitational waves computed at timelike worldtubes in the interior of a 3+1 (Cauchy) numerical relativity simulations. In our method, numerical relativity data are used as the inner inflowing boundary of a perturbative time-domain Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli simulation in hyperboloidal coordinates that reaches null infinity. We showcase waveforms from (3+1)D simulations of gravitational collapse of rotating neutron stars, binary black holes mergers and scattering, and binary neutron star mergers and compare them to other extrapolation methods. Our perturbative hyperboloidal extraction provides a simple yet efficient procedure to compute gravitational waves with data quality comparable to the Cauchy characteristic extraction for several practical applications. Nonlinear effects in the wave propagation are not captured by our method, but the present work is a stepping stone towards more sophisticated hyperboloidal schemes for gravitational-wave extraction.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">We revisit the problem of gravitational-wave extraction in numerical relativity with gauge-invariant metric perturbation theory of spherical spacetimes. Our extraction algorithm allows the computation of even-parity (Zerilli-Moncrief) and odd-parity (Regge-Wheeler) multipoles of the strain from a (3+1) metric without the assumption that the spherical background is in Schwarzschild coordinates. The algorithm is validated with a comprehensive suite of 3D problems including fluid ($f$-modes) and spacetime ($w$-modes) perturbations of neutron stars, gravitational collapse of rotating neutron stars, circular binary black holes mergers and black hole dynamical captures and binary neutron star mergers. We find that metric extraction is robust in all the considered scenarios and delivers waveforms of overall quality similar to curvature (Weyl) extraction. Metric extraction is particularly valuable in identifying waveform systematics for problems in which the reconstruction of the strain from the Weyl multipoles is ambiguous. Direct comparison of different choices for the gauge-invariant master functions show very good agreement in the even-parity sector. Instead, in the odd-parity sector, assuming the background in Schwarzschild coordinates can minimize gauge effects related to the use of the $\Gamma$-driver shift. Moreover, for optimal choices of the extraction radius, a simple extrapolation to null infinity can deliver waveforms compatible to Cauchy-characteristic extrapolated waveforms.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">In this project, we simulate the collision of two and three black holes using NRPy+ (`Python-based code generation for numerical relativity and beyond') module and BSSN (Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura) formulation, and extract the resulting gravitational waveforms. Using Brill-Lindquist initial data and sixth-order finite differences, we evolve the system using the BSSN formulation and compute the gravitational-wave signal via the Weyl scalar $\psi_4$. To assess numerical error, we plot the Hamiltonian constraint and observe that constraint violations are significantly higher in the three-black-hole collision. Unexpected gravitational recoil is also detected, which may influence waveform extraction and that is left for further investigation. Despite the limitations in computational resources imposed by the Google Colab, we successfully model the merger of a binary black hole system, and we were able to extract the corresponding gravitational waves.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">We present a new set of numerical-relativity simulations of merging binary neutron stars, aiming to identify possible observable signatures of the slope of the symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}$. To achieve this goal, we employ a set of equations of state based on a parameterization of the covariant density functional theory of nuclear matter that allows controlled variations of $L_{\rm sym}$ and the skewness $Q_{\rm sat}$, holding the latter fixed. For a set of our simulations, we identify a steep energy gradient in the equation of state at subsaturation densities, which acts as a source of heating with subsequent stiffening produced by thermal support. Accounting for related structural modifications in the tidal deformability reconciles our results with theoretical expectations. On the other hand, we show that gravitational waves are unlikely to distinguish the role of $L_{\rm sym}$. In contrast to this, we find that the ejecta composition is significantly altered in our simulations, which employ an M1 moment scheme, when $L_{\rm sym}$ is varied. Based on our extracted dynamical ejecta properties, we compute r-process yields and find that they are distinct for the different $L_{\rm sym}$, especially at lower mass numbers $A \lesssim 120$. This suggests that electromagnetic counterparts are more likely to exhibit signatures; however, a direct connection to $L_{\rm sym}$ remains a challenge, given the complex interplay between details of the ejecta properties and the kilonova signal.</div>

We have used RIFT for Bayesian parameter estimation and found that GW200208_{22} KDE estimates favor eccentricities $e_{20} = 0.217_{-0.184}^{+0.076}$ upon entering the LVK band at $\sim20$Hz within a 90% confidence limit. Within this event analysis we employed 39 new targeted full numerical relativity simulations and we have thus found a top improved likelihood $\ln \mathcal{L}$ matching waveform, compared to model-based analysis, with an estimated eccentricity at 20Hz, $e_{20}=0.200$, thus reinforcing the eccentric hypothesis of the binary. We have also used our full bank of numerical waveforms on GW190620 finding that it favors eccentricities in the range of {$0\leq e_{10}\leq0.3$}. New specifically targeted simulations will be required to narrow this eccentricity range.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">We study the properties of remnants formed in prompt-collapse binary neutron star mergers. We consider non-spinning binaries over a range of total masses and mass ratios across a set of 22 equations of state, totaling 107 numerical relativity simulations. We report the final mass and spin of the systems (including the accretion disk and ejecta) to be constrained in a narrow range, regardless of the binary configuration and matter effects. This sets them apart from binary black-hole merger remnants. We assess the detectability of the postmerger signal in a future 40 km Cosmic Explorer observatory and find that the signal-to-noise ratio in the postmerger of an optimally located and oriented binary at a distance of 100 Mpc can range from ${<}1$ to 8, depending on the binary configuration and equation of state, with a majority of them greater than 4 in the set of simulations that we consider. We also consider the distinguishability between prompt-collapse binary neutron star and binary black hole mergers with the same masses and spins. We find that Cosmic Explorer will be able to distinguish such systems primarily via the measurement of tidal effects in the late inspiral. Neutron star binaries with <em>reduced tidal deformability</em> $\tilde\Lambda$ as small as ${\sim}3.5$ can be identified up to a distance of 100 Mpc, while neutron star binaries with $\tilde\Lambda\sim22$ can be identified to distances greater than 250 Mpc. This is larger than the distance up to which the postmerger will be visible. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of our findings for the equation of state of neutron stars from the gravitational-wave event GW230529.</div>

By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the post-inflationary era.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Accurate and reliable gravitational waveform models are crucial in determining the properties of compact binary mergers. In particular, next-generation gravitational-wave detectors will require more accurate waveforms to avoid biases in the analysis. In this work, we extend the recent NRTidalv3 model to account for higher-mode corrections in the tidal phase contributions for binary neutron star systems. The higher-mode, multipolar NRTidalv3 model is then attached to several binary-black-hole baselines, such as the phenomenological IMRPhenomXHM and IMRPhenomXPHM models, and the effective-one-body-based model SEOBNRv5HM_ROM. We test the performance and validity of the newly developed models by comparing them with numerical-relativity simulations and other tidal models. Finally, we employ them in parameter estimation analyses on simulated signals from both comparable-mass and high-mass-ratio systems, as well as on the gravitational-wave event GW170817, for which we find consistent results with respect to previous analyses.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">The production site of heavy r-process elements, such as Gold and Uranium, is uncertain. Neutron star mergers are the only astrophysical phenomenon in which we have witnessed their formation. However, the amount of heavy elements resulting from the merger remains poorly constrained, mainly due to uncertainties on the mass and angular momentum of the disk formed in the merger remnant. Matter accretion from the disk is also thought to power gamma ray-bursts. We discover from numerical relativity simulations that the accretion disk influences the ringdown gravitational-wave signal produced by binaries that promptly collapse to black-hole at merger. We propose a method to <em>directly</em> measure the mass of the accretion disk left during black hole formation in binary mergers using observatories such as the Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer with a relative error of 10% for binaries at a distance of up to 30~Mpc, corresponding to an event rate of 0.001 to 0.25 events per year.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">We introduce Einstein Fields, a neural representation that is designed to compress computationally intensive four-dimensional numerical relativity simulations into compact implicit neural network weights. By modeling the <em>metric</em>, which is the core tensor field of general relativity, Einstein Fields enable the derivation of physical quantities via automatic differentiation. However, unlike conventional neural fields (e.g., signed distance, occupancy, or radiance fields), Einstein Fields are <em>Neural Tensor Fields</em> with the key difference that when encoding the spacetime geometry of general relativity into neural field representations, dynamics emerge naturally as a byproduct. Einstein Fields show remarkable potential, including continuum modeling of 4D spacetime, mesh-agnosticity, storage efficiency, derivative accuracy, and ease of use. We address these challenges across several canonical test beds of general relativity and release an open source JAX-based library, paving the way for more scalable and expressive approaches to numerical relativity.
