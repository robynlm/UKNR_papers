                <div class="paper-abstract">The demand for long and accurate gravitational waveforms is increasing as we prepare for the next generation of detectors and seek to improve current waveform models. However, numerical relativity waveforms, while highly accurate, are often too short for these applications due to their high computational cost. Hybrid waveforms, which stitch together gravitational wave signals from different modeling approaches, provide a way to generate complete inspiral-merger-ringdown signals. While hybridization is well-established for aligned-spin systems, precession introduces additional complexities due to gauge ambiguities, frame dependence, or spin dynamics. Here we study the challenges associated with alignment of precessing waveforms and present a systematic approach for constructing hybrid waveforms of precessing quasi-circular systems. Our approach relies on minimal assumptions about the merger waveforms and employs the quadrupole-aligned frame to mitigate mode-mixing. Our method is designed to be robust and broadly applicable, imposing minimal constraints on the input waveforms. This framework expands the applicability of hybridization techniques, facilitating flexible hybrid construction for parameter estimation, model calibration, and gravitational-wave data analysis.</div>

We compute the location and geometry of the apparent horizon, which depend on the spins, momenta, relative orientation angles, and the separation between the black holes, and present the result in a coordinate-independent form. We also extract the ADM mass and the irreducible mass and verify their consistency. The final expressions are depicted in a coordinate-independent form. The results can be easily extended to any number of black holes and used to complement numerical relativity simulations.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">Merger gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescence carry rich information about the underlying spacetime dynamics. We analyze merger waves from comparable-mass and extreme-mass-ratio binaries, obtained from numerical relativity and black-hole perturbation theory, respectively, and argue that they are dominated by the prompt wave emissions as the black holes collide. This signal, which we refer to as the direct wave, is modulated by the plunging motion and selectively screened by the gravitational potential of the remnant black hole. The direct wave typically exhibits a time-dependent frequency and decay rate, but for high-spin remnants $(\gtrsim0.7)$ the ergosphere renders it mode-like, with a quasi-stable instantaneous oscillation frequency close to the superradiant frequency. We further estimate its detectability in a GW150914-like system and find that the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed $\sim 10$ with the current ground-based detector network. Our results therefore identify the direct wave as a robust observable for analyzing black hole ringdowns in current and future gravitational wave events.</div>

We extend a semi-analytic seed model (Sassano et al. 2021) by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli et al. 2007; Lousto et al. 2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Pop III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by ~20-30% by z = 6 and creates a population of off-nuclear ("wandering") BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets ~0.1 arcsec and line-of-sight velocity shifts ~10^2-10^3 km/s in a few percent of high-z quasars.

                <div class="paper-abstract">We model the short gamma-ray bursts (GRB) 090510 as the product of a magnetized neutron star (NS) binary merger. Accounting for the NS critical mass constraint given by the mass of PSR J0952--0607, we infer that GRB 090510 was a highly-magnetized NS-NS merger that left as remnant a Kerr black hole (BH) of $2.4 M_\odot$ with a low-mass accretion disk. The gamma-ray precursor is powered by the magnetic energy released during the merger of the NSs. The prompt emission originates at the transparency of an ultra-relativistic $e^+e^-$ pair-plasma produced by the overcritical electric field induced by the rotating strong magnetic field around the merged object before it reaches the critical mass, the GeV emission by the extractable energy of the newborn BH, and the X-ray afterglow by accretion onto it. We derive the masses of the merging NSs, their magnetic fields, the BH mass, spin, and irreducible mass, the strength of the magnetic field, the disk mass, and obtain an estimate of the gravitational-wave emission during the merger phase preceding the prompt short GRB emission. The inferred parameters agree with up-to-date numerical relativity simulations, confirming that strong magnetic fields above $10^{14}$ G develop in NS-NS mergers and that mergers leading to a central BH remnant have low-mass disks of $\sim 10^{-2} M_\odot$. We also advance the possibility that quasi-period oscillations of tens of Hz of frequency due to Lense-Thirring precession of the matter surrounding the merged object before BH formation can explain the successive spikes following the prompt emission peak.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">The binary black hole signal GW250114, the loudest gravitational wave detected to date, offers a unique opportunity to test Einstein's general relativity (GR) in the high-velocity, strong-gravity regime and probe whether the remnant conforms to the Kerr metric. Upon perturbation, black holes emit a spectrum of damped sinusoids with specific, complex frequencies. Our analysis of the post-merger signal shows that at least two quasi-normal modes are required to explain the data, with the most damped remaining statistically significant for about one cycle. We probe the remnant's Kerr nature by constraining the spectroscopic pattern of the dominant quadrupolar ($\ell = m = 2$) mode and its first overtone to match the Kerr prediction to tens of percent at multiple post-peak times. The measured mode amplitudes and phases agree with a numerical-relativity simulation having parameters close to GW250114. By fitting a parameterized waveform that incorporates the full inspiral-merger-ringdown sequence, we constrain the fundamental $(\ell=m=4)$ mode to tens of percent and bound the quadrupolar frequency to within a few percent of the GR prediction. We perform a suite of tests -- spanning inspiral, merger, and ringdown -- finding constraints that are comparable to, and in some cases 2-3 times more stringent than those obtained by combining dozens of events in the fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. These results constitute the most stringent single-event verification of GR and the Kerr nature of black holes to date, and outline the power of black-hole spectroscopy for future gravitational-wave observations.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">When numerically solving Einstein's equations for binary black holes (BBH), we must find initial data on a three-dimensional spatial slice by solving constraint equations. The construction of initial data is a multi-step process, in which one first chooses freely specifiable data that define a conformal background and impose boundary conditions. Then, one numerically solves elliptic equations and calculates physical properties such as horizon masses, spins, and asymptotic quantities from the solution. To achieve desired properties, one adjusts the free data in an iterative ``control'' loop. Previous methods for these iterative adjustments rely on Newtonian approximations and do not allow the direct control of total energy and angular momentum of the system, which becomes particularly important in the study of hyperbolic encounters of black holes. Using the $\text{SpECTRE}$ code, we present a novel parameter control procedure that benefits from Broyden's method in all controlled quantities. We use this control scheme to minimize drifts in bound orbits and to enable the construction of hyperbolic encounters. We see that the activation of off-diagonal terms in the control Jacobian gives us better efficiency when compared to the simpler implementation in the Spectral Einstein Code ($\text{SpEC}$). We demonstrate robustness of the method across extreme configurations, including spin magnitudes up to $Ï‡ = 0.9999$, mass ratios up to $q = 50$, and initial separations up to $D_0 = 1000M$. Given the open-source nature of $\text{SpECTRE}$, this is the first time a parameter control scheme for constructing bound and unbound BBH initial data is available to the numerical-relativity community.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">The ringdown phase of the binary black hole (BBH) merger provides a clean and direct probe of strong-field gravity and tests of the nature of black holes. The quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies in modified gravity theories, as well as their amplitudes and phases, might deviate from the Kerr ones in general relativity. Charged black holes (BHs) in Einstein-Maxwell theory provide an excellent example of a beyond-Kerr solution with direct astrophysical and fundamental physics applications. In this work, we extract the ringdown mode amplitudes and phases for charged BBH mergers based on fully general relativistic simulations with charge-to-mass ratio up to 0.3. Our results suggest that even though the inspiral phase of charged BBHs can be significantly accelerated or decelerated, the ringdown mode excitation only changes mildly. We further explore the charge detectability with the ringdown-only signal for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We find that previous studies may have overestimated the charge detectability and including higher modes in charged waveforms is necessary for future ringdown analysis. This constitutes the first such analysis based on waveforms generated by numerical relativity simulations of charged BHs in full Einstein-Maxwell theory.</div>

                <div class="paper-abstract">The effective one-body (EOB) theory provides an innovative framework for analyzing the dynamics of binary systems, as articulated by Hamilton's equations. This paper investigates a self-consistent EOB theory specifically tailored for the dynamics of such systems. Our methodology begins by emphasizing how to effectively utilize the metrics derived from scattering angles in the analysis of binary black hole mergers. We then construct an effective Hamiltonian and formulate a decoupled, variable-separated Teukolsky-like equation for $Ïˆ^B_4$. Furthermore, we present the formal solution to this equation, detailing the energy flux, radiation-reaction force (RRF), and waveforms for the ``plus" and ``cross" modes generated by spinless binaries. Finally, we carry out numerical calculations using the EOB theory and compare the results with numerical relativity (NR) data from the SXS collaboration. The results indicate that to the innermost stable circular orbit, the binding energy -- angular momentum relation differs from the NR results by less than $5$\textperthousand, with a larger mass ratio yielding better agreement.</div>
